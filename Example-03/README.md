#  📘 Implement Code to Past Tests

Implement the following user story:
* As a developer, I want to write tests that will verify my API routes work as intended

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

It's done when I:

* have written code for the each path in the routes in `app.js`
* Properly use mocked data instance in the tests
* can run `npm run test` in the command line and pass all of the written tests

## 💡 Hints

The `api.test.js` has all of the functions needed for the tests. Take a look at what the `createdatabase` and `request` functions do to see where it could potentially fit in.

## 🏆 Bonus

This module uses an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) API! This is a highly robust framework to create APIs in Javascript.
