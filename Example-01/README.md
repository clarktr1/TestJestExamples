#  ðŸ“˜ Implement Tests to Verify Code Functionality

Implement the following user story:
* As a developer, I want to write tests that will show my code works.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria

It's done when I:
* have written test suite in `fizzbuzz.test.js`
* can run `npm run test` in the command line and pass all of the written tests

## ðŸ’¡ Hints

What clues can be found inside of `index.js` to help us know what and how many tests to write?
