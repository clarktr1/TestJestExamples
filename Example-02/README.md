#  📘 Implement Code to Past Tests

Implement the following user story:
* As a developer, I want to write code that will pass all of my tests.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

It's done when I:
* have written code for the algorithms in `index.js`
* can run `npm run test` in the command line and pass all of the written tests

## 💡 Hints

Given the tests found in `tests/algo.test.js`, what can we understand about the functionality of each of the algorithms?
